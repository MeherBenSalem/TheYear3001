## Building

Build a specific version from inside that version folder:

```powershell
cd 1.20.1
.\gradlew.bat build --no-daemon
```

Build all version roots from the repository root:

```powershell
.\gradlew.bat buildAll --no-daemon
```

Built mod JARs are collected under `all-jars/` when using the root `buildAll` task.

Set per-workspace Java when building from the repository root:

```powershell
$env:JAVA_HOME_17 = "C:\Program Files\Eclipse Adoptium\jdk-17.0.19.10-hotspot"
$env:JAVA_HOME_21 = "C:\Program Files\Eclipse Adoptium\jdk-21.0.11.10-hotspot"
$env:JAVA_HOME_25 = "C:\Program Files\Eclipse Adoptium\jdk-25.0.4.7-hotspot"
.\gradlew.bat buildAll --no-daemon
```
